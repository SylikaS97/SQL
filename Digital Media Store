--First I checked the database for customers who did not live in the US--

SELECT Customerid,Firstname,Lastname,Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'United States'

-- I checked for customers who lived in Brazil--
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'
-- Checked the invoices of customers who are from Brazil.
SELECT invoices.invoiceid,invoices.invoicedate,invoices.billingcountry,customers.firstname,customers.lastname,
FROM chinook.invoices LEFT JOIN chinook.customers ON invoices.customerid = customers.customerid
ORDER BY country = 'Brazil'

- Tried a different query for the invoices of customers from Brazil--
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

-- Found all employess who's jobtitle is a Sales Support Agent--
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE title='Sales Support Agent'

-- Found all the invoices for people who's biling state started and ended with NV--
SELECT *
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE billingstate LIKE '%NV%'

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices ;

-- Joined the invoice,employees and customer table to find the invoices associated with each sales agent--
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

--Found the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers--
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

-- How many invoices in 2009--
SELECT COUNT (invoicedate)
FROM INVOICES
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

-- How many total sales in 2009--
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

-Joined tracks and invoice items to the purchased track name with each invoice line ID--
SELECT tracks.name,invoice_items.invoiceid
FROM tracks JOIN invoice_items ON tracks.trackid = invoice_items.trackid

in continuation from the last query I joined the tables to find purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID
SELECT tracks.name,invoice_items.invoiceid, tracks.composer
FROM tracks JOIN invoice_items ON tracks.trackid = invoice_items.trackid
